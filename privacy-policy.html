<h1>Privacy Policy – Qarar</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

<p>
Qarar (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) is a real estate operations and management application
designed for demonstration and operational workflow purposes.
This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the app.
</p>

<h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
<p>
Qarar is intended to demonstrate real estate operational workflows such as tenant management,
property tracking, Arabic RTL contracts, and VAT-compliant invoice generation for UAE-based SMEs.
The app does <strong>not</strong> provide real estate listings, brokerage services, or government-linked services.
</p>

<h2>2. Use of Demo / Mock Data</h2>
<p>
• All data shown in the app (including tenant names, property details, invoices, TRN numbers, and amounts)
is <strong>mock or demo data</strong> used strictly for testing, demonstration, or internal evaluation purposes.<br>
• No real persons, businesses, or properties are represented unless explicitly configured by the user.<br>
• Any resemblance to real entities is purely coincidental.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
• Qarar does <strong>not</strong> collect, sell, or share personal data for advertising or tracking purposes.<br>
• Data entered by users (such as tenant or property information) is stored only for app functionality
and remains under the user’s control.<br>
• No background data harvesting or profiling is performed.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Usage</h2>
<p>
Data entered into the app is used only to:
<br>• Generate invoices and contracts
<br>• Display dashboards and summaries
<br>• Demonstrate real estate operational workflows
</p>

<h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
• Data may be stored locally on the device or on a configured backend controlled by the app owner.<br>
• Qarar does not transmit data to third parties by default.<br>
• Users are responsible for managing and securing any real data they choose to enter.
</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
• Qarar does not include advertising SDKs or user-tracking analytics.<br>
• Optional features such as OCR or PDF generation operate only on user-provided content.<br>
• No third-party service is used to collect personal user information without disclosure.
</p>

<h2>7. Legal Disclaimer & Affiliation</h2>
<p>
• Qarar is <strong>not affiliated</strong> with UAE government authorities, including but not limited to
RERA, DLD, or any official real estate registry.<br>
• The app does not claim to be an official real estate platform or listing service.<br>
• Users must not rely on Qarar as a legal substitute for licensed real estate systems.
</p>

<h2>8. Copyright & Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>
• All app branding, UI, and generated documents belong to their respective owners.<br>
• Sample names, invoices, and Arabic text are used for demonstration only.<br>
• If you believe any content violates intellectual property rights, please contact us for prompt review and removal.
</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
Qarar is provided “as-is” for demonstration and operational support purposes.
We are not responsible for legal, financial, or regulatory consequences resulting from
the use of demo data or user-entered information.
</p>

<h2>10. Policy Updates</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect feature changes, legal requirements,
or platform compliance updates. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
